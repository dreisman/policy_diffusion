The legislature finds that:\n\n2 (1) Most workers in the State, at some time during the\n3 year, need temporary time off from work to take care\n\n4 of personal health needs or the health needs of\n\n5 members of \u2022their families;\n\n6 (2) Nationally, nearly forty per cent of private sector\n7 workers are without any paid sick leave. In this\n\n8 State, an estimated forty-three per cent of private\n\n9 sector workers lack paid sick leave;\n\n10 (3) Low-income workers are significantly less likely to\n11 have paid sick leave than other members of the\n\n12 workforce. Only one in five low-income workers has\n\n13 access to paid sick leave;\n\n14 (4) Providing workers time off to attend to their personal\n15 health care needs and the health care needs of family\n\n16 members would ensure a healthier and more productive\n\n17 workforce in the State;\n\nHB HNS 2014\u20144294\u20142\n~\n\n\n\nH.B. rsIc~. 9.\n1 (5) Nearly two hundred fifty thousand people in the State\n2 serve as unpaid family caregivers for family members,\n\n3 work that has an aggregate value of $1,900,000 per\n\n4 year. Working family caregivers cannot adequately\n\n5 care for their relatives without access to paid sick\n\n6 leave;\n\n7 (6) Paid sick leave would have a positive effect on the\n8 public health of residents of the State by allowing\n\n9 workers the option of staying home when ill,. thus\n\n10 lessening recovery time and reducing the likelihood of\n\n11 spreading illness to other members of the workforce\n\n12 and to the public;\n\n13 (7) Paid sick leave will reduce health care expenditures\n14 by promoting access to primary and preventive care.\n\n15 Nationally, providing all workers with paid sick leave\n\n16 would result in $1,100,000,000 in annual savings in\n\n17 hospital emergency room costs, including more than\n\n18 $500,000,000 in savings to publicly funded health\n\n19 insurance programs such as Medicare, medicaid, and the\n\n20 state children\u2019s health insurance program. Access to\n\n21 paid sick leave can also help decrease the likelihood\n\nHB ElMS 2014\u20144294\u20142 2\n~\n\n\n\nPage3 H.B. Nc~. q\n\n1 that a worker will put off needed care and increase\n\n2 the use of preventive care among workers and their\n\n3 family members;\n\n4 (8) Paid sick leave will allow parents to provide personal\n5 care for their sick children. Parental care makes\n\n6 children\u2019s recovery faster and can prevent future\n\n7 health problems. Parents who do not have paid sick\n\nS leave are more than twice as likely as parents with\n\n9 , paid sick days to send a sick child to school or\n\n10 daycare and are five times as likely to report taking\n\n11 their child or other family member to a hospital\n\n12 emergency room because they were unable to take time\n\n13 off from work during regular work hours;\n\n14 (9) Paid sick leave will reduce contagion. Workers in\n15 jobs with high levels of public contact, such as\n16 restaurant workers and child care workers, are very\n\n17 unlikely to have paid sick leave. As a result, these\n\n18 workers may have no choice but to go to work when they\n\n19 are ill, thereby increasing the risk of passing\n\n20 illnesses on to co-workers and customers while\n\n21 jeopardizing their own health. Overall, people\n\nHE HMS 2014\u20144294\u20142 3\n~\n\n\n\nH.B. NO. \u00b0i\n\n1 without paid sick leave are 1.5 times more likely than\n\n2 people with paid sick leave to go to work with a\n\n3 contagious illness like the flu;\n\n4 (10) Employees frequently lose their jobs or are\n5 disciplined for taking sick leave to care for sick\n\n6 family members or even to recover from their own\n\n7 illness. One in six workers report that they or a\n\n8 family member has been fired, suspended, punished, or\n\n9 threatened by an employer because they needed to take\n\n10 sick leave for themselves or a family member;\n\nU (11) When an outbreak that presents a threat to public\n12 health occurs, for example the H1N1 outbreak of 2009,\n\n13 government officials request that sick workers stay\n\n14 home and keep sick children home from school or child\n\n15 care to prevent the spread of the illness and to\n\n16 safeguard workplace productivity. However, to protect\n\n17 their paychecks and their jobs, many workers who lack\n18 paid sick leave are unable to comply with these\n\n19 requests;\n\n20 (12) During the height of the H1N1 pandemic, workers with\n21 lower rates of access to paid sick leave were more\n\nHB HMS 2014\u20144294\u20142 4\n~\n\n\n\nPages H.B. NC). 9\n\n1 likely than those with higher rates of access to paid\n\n2 sick leave to go to work sick. As a result, the\n\n3 pandemic lasted longer in their workplaces as the\n\n4 virus spread from co-worker to co-worker. A new study\n\n5 estimates that lack of paid sick leave was responsible\n\n6 for five million cases of influenza-like illness\n\n7 during the pandemic;\n\n8 (13) Providing a minimal amount of paid sick leave is\n9 affordable for employers. Paid sick leave results in\n\n10 reduced worker turnover, which leads to reduced costs\n\n11 incurred from advertising, interviewing, and training\n\n12 new hires. Firing and replacing workers can cost\n\n13 anywhere from twenty-five to two hundred per cent of\n\n14 an employee\u2019s annual compensation;\n\n15 (14) Paid sick leave will reduce the risk of\n16 \u201cpresenteeism\u201d, or workers coming to work with\n\n17 illnesses and health conditions that reduce their\n\n18 productivity, a problem that costs the national\n\n19 ec\u00e0nomy $160,000,000,000 annually; and\n\nHE HMS 2014\u20144294\u20142 5\n~\n\n\n\nH.B. i\u2019io. c~\n1 (15) Paid sick leave will reduce the competitive\n2 disadvantage currently faced by the many employers\n\n3 that do choose to provide sick time to their workers.\n\n4 The purpose of this Act is to establish the right for\n\n5 workers to accrue paid sick leave to:\n\n6 (1) Ensure that all workers in the State can address their\n7 own health needs and the health needs of their\n\n8 families by requiring employers to provide a minimum\n\n9 level of paid sick leave, including time for family\n\n10 care;\n\n11 (2) Diminish public and private health care costs in the\n12 State by enabling workers to seek early and routine\n\n13 medical care for themselves and their family members;\n\n14 (3) Protect public health in the State by reducing the\n15 risk of contagion;\n\n16 (4) Promote economic security and stability of workers and\n17 their families in the State;\n\n18 (5) Protect employees in the State from losing their jobs\n19 - when they use sick leave to care for themselves or\n\n20 their families;\n\nHB HMS 2014\u20144294\u20142 6\n~\n\n\n\nHB.

The legislature finds that:\n\n2 (1) Most workers in the State, at some time during the\n3 year, need temporary time off from work to take care\n\n4 of personal health needs or the health needs of\n\n5 members of their families;\n\n6 (2) Nationally, nearly forty per cent of private sector\n7 workers are without any paid sick leave. In addition,\n\n8 many workers who do have paid sick time either are\n\n9 disciplined for using it or cannot use the time to\n\n10 care for sick children. In this State, an estimated\n\n11 forty-three per cent of private sector workers lack\n\n12 paid sick leave;\n\n13 (3) Low income workers are significantly less likely to\n14 have paid sick leave than other members of the\n\n15 workforce. Only one in five low income workers has\n\n16 access to paid sick leave;\n\nHB LRB l5-0563.doc\n~\n\n\n\nRB.

Access to\n\n4 paid sick leave can also help decrease the likelihood\n\n5 that a worker will put off needed care and increase\n\n6 the use of preventive care among workers and their\n\n7 children;\n\n8 (8) Paid sick leave will allow parents to provide personal\n9 care for their sick children. Parental care makes\n\n10 children\u2019s recovery faster and can prevent future\n\n11 health problems. Parents who do not have paid sick\n\n12 time are more than twice as likely as parents with\n\n13 paid sick days to send a sick child to school or day\n\n14 care and are five times as likely to report taking\n\n15 t~ieir child or a family member to a hospital emergency\n\n16 room because they were unable to take time off from\n\n17 work during regular woi~k hours;\n\n18 (9) Paid sick leave will reduce contagion. Workers in\n19 jobs with high levels of public contact, such as\n20 restaurant workers and child care workers, are very\n\n21 unlikely to have paid sick time. As a result, these\n\nHE LRB lS-0563.doc 3\n~\n\n\n\nH.B. NO. 1a4Th\n\n1 workers may have no choice but to go to work when they\n\n2 are ill, thereby increasing the risk of passing\n\n3 illnesses on to co-workers and customers while\n\n4 jeopardizing their own health. Overall, people\n5 without paid sick leave are 1.5 times more likely than\n\n6 people with paid sick leave to go to work with a\n\n7 contagious illness like the flu;\n\n8 (10) Employees frequently lose their jobs or are\n9 disciplined for taking sick leave to care for sick\n\n10 family members or even to recover from their own\n\n11 illness. One in six workers report that they or a\n\n12 family member has been fired, suspended, punished, or\n\n13 threatened by an employer because they needed to take\n\n14 sick leave for themselves or a family member;\n\n15 (11) when an outbreak that presents a threat to public\n16 health occurs, for example, the H1N1 outbreak of 2009,\n\n17 government officials request that sick workers stay\n\n18 home and keep sick children home from school or child\n\n19 care to prevent the spread of the virus and to\n\n20 safeguard workplace productivity. However, to protect\n\n21 their paychecks and their jobs, many workers who lack\n\n113 LRB lS-0563..doc 4\n~\n\n\n\nH.B.

As a result, the\n\n7 pandemic lasted longer in their workplaces as the\n\n8 virus spread from co-worker to co-worker. A new study\n\n9 estimates that lack of paid sick leave was responsible\n\n10 for five million cases of influenza-like illness\n\n11 during the pandemic;\n\n12 (13) Providing a minimal amount of paid sick leave is\n13 affordable for employers. Paid sick leave results in\n\n14 reduced worker turnover, which leads to reduced costs\n\n15 incurred from advertising, interviewing, and training\n\n16 new hires. Firing and replacing workers can cost\n\n17 anywhere from twenty-five to two hundred per cent of\n\n18 an employee\u2019s annual compensation;\n\n19 (14) Paid sick leave will reduce the risk of\n20 \u201cpresenteeism\u201d, or workers coming to work with\n\n21 illnesses and health conditions that reduce their\n\nHE LRB 15-0563.doc\nI~I~Ih UI II~I hIIIU~I~ I1~II~ ID~II II h[1I~I II~I II\n\n\n\nH.B.

Each year, women experience about\n\n9 4,800,000 intimate partner related physical assaults\n\n10 and rapes. Men are the victims of about 2,900,000\n\n11 intimate partner related physical assaults. Many\n\n12 workers need time off to care for their health after\n\n13 these incidents o~ to find solutions, such as a\n\n14 restraining order or new housing, to avoid or prevent\n\n15 further physical or sexual abuse;\n\n16 (17) Survivors of domestic and sexual violence are forced\n17 to lose days of paid employment because of the\n\n18 violence they face. The mean number of days of paid\n\n19 work lost by survivors of rape is 8.1 days, by\n\n20 survivors of physical assault 7.2 days, and by\n\n21 survivors of stalking 10.1 days; and\n\nRB LRB 15-0563.doc 6\n~\n\n\n\nRB.

Findings and purpose.\n\n\t7\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) The General Assembly finds:\n\t8\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1) Nearly every worker in the State is likely to need \n\t9\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0time off to attend to his or her own illness or that of a \n\t10\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0family member.  More than 40% of all private sector workers \n\t11\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in Illinois (over 2,500,000 people) have no right to a paid \n\t12\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sick day. Over three-fourths of the lowest-wage workers do \n\t13\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not receive paid sick days and cannot forfeit a day's work, \n\t14\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0so they often come into work sick.\n\t15\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2) Of those workers who receive paid sick days, few \n\t16\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0policies, in both the private and public sectors, allow the \n\t17\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0worker to use it to care for a family member who is ill.\n\n\t18\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3) Preventive and routine medical care helps avoid \n\t19\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0illness and injury by detecting illnesses early on and \n\t20\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0shortening the duration of illnesses. Providing employees \n\t21\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with time off to attend to their own health care needs \n\t22\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ensures that they will be healthier and more efficient \n\t23\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0employees.  It will also reduce the spread of disease within \n\n\t\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\t\tSB1836\t- 2 -\tLRB099 09642 JLS 29851 b\n\n\n\t\n\n\t1\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0workplaces and to the public, such as customers, when \n\t2\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0employees go to work sick, a practice known as \n\t3\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"presenteeism\".  Routine medical care results in savings by \n\t4\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0detecting and treating illness and injury early and \n\t5\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0decreasing the need for emergency care. These savings \n\t6\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0benefit public and private payers of health insurance.\n\t7\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(4) When the school of a worker's child is closed \n\t8\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0because of extreme weather, it is often at the last minute \n\t9\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and workers cannot find someone to babysit so they are \n\t10\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0forced to stay at home to take care of their children.\n\t11\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(5) Nearly one-quarter of American women report \n\t12\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0domestic violence and nearly one in 5 women report \n\t13\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0experiencing rape at some time during their lives.  Many \n\t14\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0workers, men and women, need time off to care for their \n\t15\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0health after these incidents or to take legal action. \n\t16\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without paid time off, victims are in danger of losing \n\t17\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0their jobs.\n\t18\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(6) Employers that provide paid sick days see better \n\t19\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0productivity, reduced flu contagion, and lower turnover, \n\t20\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0which saves them the costs of replacing and training \n\t21\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0workers.\n\n\t22\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) This Act is enacted to establish the Healthy Workplace \n\t23\t\tAct to provide at least a minimum time-off standard of paid \n\t24\t\tsick days for all workers.\n\u00a0\n\t25\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 10.

Legislative intent. The legislature finds that nearly every\n    2  worker  at  some  time  during each year will need time off from work to\n    3  take care of his or her health needs  or  the  health  needs  of  family\n    4  members.   Providing the right to earned sick time will therefore have a\n    5  positive effect on the public health of the state and lessen the  spread\n    6  of and exposure to diseases. The legislature further finds that support-\n    7  ing  a  healthy  workforce  will  foster  greater employee retention and\n    8  productivity, and recognizes that responsible  businesses  that  already\n    9  have  policies  that allow time off that amounts to at least the minimum\n   10  requirements under this law, and that can be taken for the same  reasons\n   11  and  under  the  same conditions as enumerated in this legislation, will\n   12  not be required to provide additional  sick  time.  Providing  sick  and\n   13  vacation  time  to  workers at a time when the economy is improving, and\n   14  ensuring that workers' jobs are protected when they need to take a  sick\n   15  day,  strikes  the  right  balance and will result in a more prosperous,\n   16  safe and healthy state.\n   17    S 2.

Short title.\n\n7This act shall be known and may be cited as the Healthy\n8Families, Healthy Workplaces Act.\n\n9Section 2.   Declaration of policy.\n\n10The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:\n\n11(1)   Nearly every worker in this Commonwealth will at\n12some time during the year need temporary time off from work\n13to take care of the worker's own health needs or the health\n14needs of family members or to deal with safety issues arising\n15from domestic or sexual violence.\n\n16(2)   There are many workers in this Commonwealth who are\n17not entitled to any paid sick leave to care for their own\n \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t20150HB0624PN0724\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-1-\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1health needs or the health needs of family members.\n\n2(3)   Low-income workers are significantly less likely to\n3have paid sick leave than other members of the work force.\n\n4(4)   Providing workers time off to attend to their own\n5health care and the health care of family members will ensure\n6a healthier and more productive work force in this\n7Commonwealth.\n\n8(5)   Paid sick leave will have a positive effect on\n9public health in this Commonwealth by allowing sick workers\n10the occasional option of staying home to care for themselves\n11when ill thus lessening their recovery time and reducing the\n12likelihood of spreading illness to other members of the work\n13force.\n\n14(6)   Paid sick leave will allow parents to provide\n15personal care for their sick children. Parental care makes\n16children's recovery faster, prevents more serious illnesses\n17and improves children's overall mental and physical health.\n\n18(7)   Providing minimal paid sick leave is affordable for\n19employers and good for business.\n\n20(8)   Employers who provide paid sick leave have greater\n21employee retention and avoid the problem of workers coming to\n22work sick. Studies have shown that costs from on-the-job\n23productivity losses resulting from sick workers on the job\n24exceed the cost of absenteeism among employees.\n\n25Section 3.

Referred to Committee on Labor.\n\n\nAN ACT Relating to assuring that all workers may take at least forty hours of accrued paid sick or safe leave per year and that workers for employers with more than fifty full-time equivalent employees may take greater amounts of paid leave, excepting only certain occasional Washington workers, workers of employers with four or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and workers in certain new firms; adding a new chapter to Title 49 RCW; and prescribing penalties.\nBE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0FINDINGS AND INTENT. The legislature finds that paid sick and safe leave from employment is critical to the economic well-being of the state and workers and to public health and safety. Paid sick and safe leave helps workers maintain their own health and the health of their families, coworkers, and members of the public. Paid sick and safe leave is important to helping women gain greater economic security for themselves and their families and to achieving racial and gender equity. Paid sick and safe leave also helps give victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking the financial independence necessary to leave abusive situations, achieve safety, and minimize physical and emotional injuries. The legislature further finds that paid sick and safe leave helps employers retain trained workers and operate competitively as well as ensures that workers and their families retain economic security.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0DEFINITIONS. The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.\n(1) \"Child,\" \"grandparent,\" \"parent,\" \"parent-in-law,\" and \"spouse\" have the same meanings as in RCW  49.12.265.\n(2) \"Department\" and \"director\" have the same meanings as in RCW  49.12.005.\n(3) \"Domestic violence\" has the same meaning as in RCW  26.50.010.\n(4)(a) \"Employee\" means any individual employed by an employer, including individuals employed on a temporary and part-time basis.\n(b) An employee is a \"covered employee\" when the employee performs services in the state. An employee performing services in the state on an occasional basis is a covered employee only if he or she performs more than two hundred forty hours of work in the state in a calendar year. An employee performing services in the state on a temporary basis and supplied by a temporary service, staffing agency, or similar entity, absent a contractual agreement stating otherwise, is a covered employee of the staffing agency or similar entity.\n(5)(a) \"Employer\" has the same meaning as in RCW  49.12.005.\n(i) \"Tier one employer\" means an employer that employs more than four and fewer than fifty full-time equivalents on average per calendar week.\n(ii) \"Tier two employer\" means an employer that employs at least fifty and fewer than two hundred fifty full-time equivalents on average per calendar week.\n(iii) \"Tier three employer\" means an employer that employs two hundred fifty or more full-time equivalents on average per calendar week.\n(b) The employer tier for the current year is determined by the average number of full-time equivalents paid per calendar week during the preceding year for any and all weeks during which at least one employee worked for compensation. To determine the number of full-time equivalents, all compensated hours of all employees shall be counted, including part-time employment, temporary employment, employment outside the state, and employment through the services of a staffing agency or similar entity. Separate entities that form an integrated enterprise are a single employer for purposes of determining the employer tier. If an employer did not employ any employees during the previous year, the employer tier is determined based upon the average number of full-time equivalents paid per calendar week during the first ninety calendar days of the current year in which the employer engaged in business.\n(6) \"Full-time equivalent\" means the number of hours worked for compensation that add up to one full-time employee, based either on an eight hour day and a five day week or as full-time is defined, in writing or in practice, by the employer.\n(7) \"Health care provider\" means any person licensed to provide medical or emergency services and any other person as determined by the director to be capable of providing documentation under section 5(4) of this act.\n(8) \"Sexual assault\" has the same meaning as in RCW  70.125.030.\n(9) \"Sick and safe leave\" means hours of paid time provided by an employer for use by a covered employee for absence from work for the purposes specified in section 4 of this act.\n(10) \"Staffing agency\" means any person undertaking with or without compensation to procure opportunities to work or to procure, recruit, refer, or place individuals with an employer or in employment.\n(11) \"Stalking\" has the same meaning as in RCW  9A.46.110.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0ACCRUAL OF SICK AND SAFE LEAVE. (1)(a) Subject to (b) of this subsection and beginning January 1st of the year following the effective date of this section, a covered employee accrues sick and safe leave, which may be used as either sick leave or safe leave, as follows:\n(i) An employee of a tier one or tier two employer must accrue at least one hour of leave for every forty hours worked.\n(ii) An employee of a tier three employer must accrue at least one hour of leave for every thirty hours worked.\n(b) An employer may provide paid sick and safe leave in advance of accrual as permitted front loading as long as the front loading meets or exceeds the requirements of this chapter for accrual, use, and carry over of leave.\n(2) Sick and safe leave begins to accrue at the commencement of employment, except that an employee is not entitled to begin accruing leave before January 1st of the year following the effective date of this section.\n(3) If an employee is exempt from overtime payment under state and federal law: (a) The employee is not entitled to accrue leave for hours worked in excess of forty hours in a work week; and (b) if the employee's normal work week is less than forty hours, leave accrues based on the employee's normal work week.\n(4) Unused sick and safe leave carries over to the following year, except that an employer is not required to allow an employee to carry over sick and safe leave in excess of:\n(a) Forty hours for a tier one employer;\n(b) Fifty-six hours for a tier two employer; or\n(c) Subject to subsection (5) of this section, seventy-two hours for a tier three employer.\n(5)(a) A tier one or tier two employer with a combined or universal paid leave policy, including but not limited to a paid time off policy, is not required to provide sick and safe leave in addition to the leave provided by that policy if:\n(i) Paid leave under the policy may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as sick and safe leave may be used under section 4 of this act;\n(ii) Paid leave accrues at a rate of at least one hour of leave for every forty hours worked;\n(iii) Use of paid leave within any year is limited to no less than the amounts specified for tier one and tier two employers, respectively, in section 4 of this act; and\n(iv) Any accrued but unused paid leave may be carried over to the following year. However, this section does not require a tier one or tier two employer to carry over leave in excess of the leave specified in subsection (4)(a) and (b) of this section.\n(b) A tier three employer with a combined or universal paid leave policy, including but not limited to a paid time off policy, is not required to provide sick and safe leave in addition to the leave provided by the policy if:\n(i) Available paid leave may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as sick and safe leave may be used under section 4 of this act;\n(ii) Paid leave accrues at a rate of at least one hour of leave for every thirty hours worked;\n(iii) Use of paid leave within any year is limited to no less one hundred eight hours; and\n(iv) Any accrued but unused paid leave may be carried over to the following year. However, this section does not require a tier three employer to carry over unused leave in excess of one hundred eight hours.\n(6) If a covered employee separates from employment and the same employer rehires the employee within seven months of the separation: (a) The employer must reinstate previously accrued and unused sick and safe leave; (b) the employee is entitled to use accrued sick and safe leave immediately upon reemployment if the employee previously had been eligible to use the leave; and (c) the employee accrues additional leave immediately upon reemployment. If a covered employee separates from employment and the same employer rehires the employee more than seven months after the separation, this section does not require the employer to reinstate accrued sick and safe leave and the employee is considered to have newly commenced employment for purposes of sick and safe leave.\n(7) This section does not require an employer to provide financial or other reimbursement for accrued and unused sick and safe leave to any employee upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0USE OF SICK AND SAFE LEAVE. (1) A covered employee may use accrued sick and safe leave beginning one hundred eighty days after the commencement of employment with the employer. If a covered employee separates from employment and is rehired by the same employer within seven months of separation, the previous period of employment is counted for purposes of meeting the one hundred eighty day requirement.\n(2) An employer must compensate a covered employee who uses sick and safe leave at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits, including health care benefits, as the employee would have earned during the time the leave is taken. An employer is not required to compensate an employee for lost tips or commissions and compensation is required only for hours that an employee was scheduled to work.\n(3) A covered employee may use sick leave for the following reasons:\n(a) An absence resulting from an employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; to accommodate the employee's need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or the employee's need for preventive medical care; or\n(b) To allow the employee to provide care for a child, grandparent, parent, parent-in-law, or spouse with a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; care for a child, grandparent, parent, parent-in-law, or spouse who needs medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or care for a child, grandparent, parent, parent-in-law, or spouse who needs preventive medical care.\n(4) A covered employee may use safe leave for the following reasons:\n(a) When the employee's place of business has been closed by order of a public official to limit exposure to an infectious agent, biological toxin, or hazardous material; or to accommodate the employee's need to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official to limit exposure to an infectious agent, biological toxin, or hazardous material; or\n(b) For any of the reasons identified in RCW  49.76.030.\n(5) An employer is not required to allow an employee to use in excess of the following hours of sick and safe leave in a year:\n(a) Forty hours for a tier one employer;\n(b) Fifty-six hours for a tier two employer; or\n(c) Subject to section 3(5)(b) of this act, seventy-two hours for a tier three employer.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a05.\u00a0\u00a0REQUESTS AND DOCUMENTATION. (1) An employer must provide sick and safe leave upon the request of a covered employee.\n(2) When possible, the request must include the expected duration of the absence. An employer may require an employee to comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for absences and requesting leave, as long as the requirements do not interfere with the purposes for which the leave is needed. If the leave is foreseeable, the employee must: (a) Make a reasonable effort to schedule the leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer; (b) make the request in writing; and (c) make the request at least ten days, or as early as possible, in advance of the leave unless the employer's usual and customary notice requirements provide for less advance notice. If the leave is unforeseeable, the employee must provide notice as soon as practicable and must comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for absences as long as the requirements do not interfere with the purposes for which the leave is needed.\n(3) For employees covered by federal or state overtime requirements, sick and safe leave may be used in hourly increments, or smaller increments if an employer so designates. For employees exempt from state and federal overtime requirements, the employer may make deductions of sick and safe leave in accordance with state and federal law.\n(4) An employer may require reasonable documentation for use of more than three consecutive days of sick leave. Documentation signed by a health care provider stating that sick leave is necessary is reasonable documentation. An employer may not require the documentation to explain the nature of the illness, injury, or health condition. The employer and employee must each pay one-half the cost of any out-of-pocket expense incurred by the employee in obtaining the documentation requested by the employer. Out-of-pocket expenses are limited to the costs of services provided by health care providers, services of health care facilities, testing prescribed by health care providers, and transportation to the location where the services are provided.\n(5) An employer may require verification for use of more than three consecutive days of safe leave. For leave under section 4(4)(a) of this act, the employer may require verification of a closure order. Notice of the closure order in whatever format the employee received the notice satisfies the verification request. For leave under section 4(4)(b) of this act, the employer may require verification that the employee or employee's family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and that the leave taken was for one of the purposes under section 4(4)(b) of this act. An employee may satisfy the verification requirement in the same manner as provided in RCW  49.76.040(4) and verification does not waive or diminish the confidential or privileged nature of communications in the same manner as under RCW  49.76.040(4).\n(6) Upon mutual consent of the employee and employer, an employee may work additional hours or shifts during the same or next pay period instead of using accrued sick and safe leave for leave taken under this section. An employer may not require the employee to work additional shifts or hours. The employer must comply with any applicable laws regarding overtime pay.\n(7) This chapter does not prohibit an employer from establishing a policy under which employees may: (a) Voluntarily exchange assigned hours or trade shifts; or (b) donate unused accrued sick and safe leave to another employee.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a06.\u00a0\u00a0RECORDKEEPING. (1)(a) An employer must provide at the time wages are paid information in writing stating an updated amount of sick and safe leave available to each covered employee. Employers may choose a reasonable system for providing this information including, but not limited to, listing remaining available sick and safe leave on each pay stub or providing an online system where employees can access their own sick and safe leave information.\n(b) This section does not require employers to modify their recordkeeping policies as long as records reasonably indicate accrued and used sick and safe leave. When an issue arises as to the amount of accrued sick and safe leave and the employer does not maintain or retain adequate records or does not allow the department reasonable access to the records, it is presumed that the employer violated this chapter.\n(2) Employers shall retain records documenting hours worked by employees and sick and safe leave taken by employees for a period of three years, and shall allow the department access to such records, with appropriate notice and at a mutually agreeable time, to investigate potential violations and to monitor compliance with this chapter.\n(3)(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, an employer must maintain the confidentiality of information provided by the employee or others in support of an employee's request for sick or safe leave, including health information and the fact the employee or employee's family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, that the employee has requested or taken leave under this chapter, and any written or oral statement, documentation, record, or corroborating evidence provided by the employee.\n(b) Information provided by an employee may be disclosed by an employer only if the disclosure is: (i) Requested or consented to by the employee; (ii) ordered by a court or administrative agency; or (iii) otherwise required by applicable federal or state law.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a07.\u00a0\u00a0NOTICE OF RIGHTS. (1) Beginning January 1st of the year following the effective date of this section, a tier one, tier two, and tier three employer shall give notice to employees:\n(a) That covered employees are entitled to sick and safe leave;\n(b) Of the amount of sick and safe leave and the terms of its use guaranteed under this chapter;\n(c) That retaliation against employees who request or use sick or safe leave is prohibited; and\n(d) That an employee has the right to file a complaint or bring a civil action if sick or safe leave as required by this chapter is denied by the employer or the employee is retaliated against for requesting or taking sick or safe leave.\n(2) An employer may comply with this section by providing the information in subsection (1) of this section in English and in any language that is the first language spoken by at least five percent of the employer's workforce: (a) On a notice to each of the employer's covered employees; or (b) on a poster displayed in a conspicuous and accessible place in each establishment where the employer's covered employees are employed.\n(3) The department must create and make available to employers posters for use under subsection (2) of this section.\n(4) The department must provide notice to employers regarding the requirements of this chapter when the department updates information for employers about employment standards requirements.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a08.\u00a0\u00a0RETALIATION. (1) An employer may not discharge, threaten to discharge, demote, deny a promotion to, sanction, discipline, retaliate against, harass, or otherwise discriminate against an employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee:\n(a) Exercised rights under section 4 of this act;\n(b) Filed or communicated to the employer an intent to file a complaint under section 9 or 11 of this act; or\n(c) Participated or assisted, as a witness or otherwise, in another employee's attempt to exercise rights under section 4, 9, or 11 of this act.\n(2) Counting use of paid sick and safe leave as an absence that may lead to or result in adverse action against the employee is unlawful retaliation under this section.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a09.\u00a0\u00a0ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT. (1) Upon complaint by an employee, the director must investigate to determine if there has been compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter. The director may also investigate if the director obtains information that a violation may have occurred. If upon investigation the director determines that a violation has occurred, the director must endeavor with reasonable promptness to eliminate the violation by agreement. The terms of the agreement may include any of the relief specified in section 10 of this act. If an agreement cannot be reached, the director must issue a notice of infraction. Appeal from the director's decision is governed by chapter  34.05 RCW.\n(2) Within the first twenty-four months after a tier one or tier two employer's hiring of the employer's first employee, the department may educate and advise the employer and employees but may not investigate or order any other relief.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a010.\u00a0\u00a0ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF. (1) If an employer is found to have committed an infraction, the director may order appropriate relief which may include:\n(a) Damages, including back pay, payment of any sick or safe leave unlawfully withheld, and interest on the damages at the prevailing rate;\n(b) If any sick or safe leave was unlawfully withheld, statutory damages of three times the dollar amount of leave withheld, or two hundred fifty dollars, whichever is greater;\n(c) If a violation resulted in other harm to the employee or any other person, such as discharge from employment, or otherwise violated the rights of employees or other persons, such as a failure to provide notice to employees or a prohibited act of retaliation, statutory damages of fifty dollars to each employee or person whose rights were violated for each day or portion of each day that the violation occurred or continued;\n(d) To compensate the department for the costs of investigating or remedying the violation, not more than fifty dollars for each day or portion of each day and for each person or employee as to whom the violation occurred or continued;\n(e) Attorneys' fees and costs; and\n(f) Equitable relief, including reinstatement.\n(2) In addition to any other remedies, if the director finds that an employer has willfully violated the notice and posting requirements of section 7 of this act, the director may impose a civil penalty not to exceed one hundred twenty-five dollars for the first violation and two hundred fifty dollars for subsequent violations.\n(3) A judicial appeal from the director's determination may be taken in accordance with chapter  34.05 RCW, and an aggrieved employee who prevails and a person awarded statutory damages who prevails are entitled to attorneys' fees and costs.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a011.\u00a0\u00a0CIVIL ENFORCEMENT. (1) The department and any person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, any entity a member of which is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, or any other person or entity acting on behalf of the public health and welfare may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against any person who violates this chapter. The court may order appropriate relief including the relief specified in section 10 of this act, except that any person or entity enforcing this chapter on behalf of the public health and welfare is not entitled to statutory damages. In addition, the court shall award reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to the party bringing the civil action if the party prevails.\n(2) Exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required before filing a civil action.\n(3) The remedies in this section are in addition to any common law or other remedies that may be available.\n(4) This section does not apply to any violations during the first twenty-four months after a tier one or tier two employer's hiring of the employer's first employee.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a012.\u00a0\u00a0MORE GENEROUS POLICIES. This chapter provides minimum requirements pertaining to sick and safe leave and is not intended to discourage and does not prohibit an employer from adopting or retaining a sick and safe leave policy more generous than any policies that comply with the requirements under this chapter, or as diminishing the obligation of any employer to comply with any contract, collective bargaining agreement, employment benefit plan, or other agreement providing more generous sick and safe leave than required under this chapter.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a013.\u00a0\u00a0RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS. This chapter does not preempt, limit, or otherwise affect the applicability of any other law, regulation, requirement, policy, or standard that provides for greater accrual or use by employees of sick or safe leave, whether paid or unpaid, or that extends other protections to employees.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a014.\u00a0\u00a0WAIVER. (1) The requirements of this chapter do not apply to any employees covered by a bona fide collective bargaining agreement to the extent that the requirements are expressly waived in the collective bargaining agreement in clear and unambiguous terms.\n(2) Any waiver by an employee of any requirements of this chapter is contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable.\nNEW SECTION.\u00a0\u00a0Sec.\u00a015.\u00a0\u00a0RULES.

The general court finds that all workers in New Hampshire can address their own health and safety needs and the health and safety needs of their families by requiring employers to provide a minimum level of paid sick and safe days including time for family care.  The general court further finds that enabling workers to seek medical care for themselves and their family members diminishes public and private health care costs in New Hampshire.  The general court seeks to safeguard the public welfare, health, safety, and prosperity of New Hampshire.\n\n\n2  New Chapter; Paid Sick Leave for Employees.

There will be no impact on state, county, and local revenue.  \n\n\n  The Office of Legislative Budget Assistant is awaiting information from the Judicial Branch relative to the potential fiscal impact of this bill.  The Branch was contacted on 01/07/15 to provide the information.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\n\n\nThe Department of Administrative Services states this bill requires employers to provide employees, including part-time employees, with up to 40 hours of paid sick leave per year.  The Department states the State of New Hampshire already provides full-time employees with leave accruals greater than those identified in the bill, so there will be no additional cost related to full-time employees.  The State does not, however, currently provide paid sick leave to part-time employees.  The Department estimates this provision will increase state expenditures by $8,914,788 per year, calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\t6,413 classified part-time employees\n\n\n\t$14.20 average hourly rate for classified part-time employees\n\n\n\t6,413 employees * $14.20 hourly rate * 40 hours of leave = $3,642,584\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t3,635 non-classified part-time employees\n\n\n\t$36.26 average hourly rate for non-classified part-time employees\n\n\n\t3,365 employees * $36.26 * 40 hours of leave = $5,272,204\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tTotal: $8,914,788\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nIn addition to the costs identified above, the Department states there may be indeterminable costs associated with the proposed language in RSA 275-G:2, VII, which indicates that upon separation from employment, if an employee is rehired within 12 months of separation by the same employer, previously accrued sick leave that had not been used may be reinstated at the discretion of the employer.  The Department notes that the State of New Hampshire does not currently reinstate unused sick leave for current full-time employees, and if it chose to do so, an additional cost would be generated.  In addition, the State provides health coverage for employees that are absent on paid sick time; this additional leave would extend the state\u2019s obligation to offer paid coverage beyond what is currently provided.  \n\n\n  The Department of Labor states the bill will have an indeterminable impact on expenditures.  The Department states that although it already has a process in place for hearing labor disputes, the number of hearings may increase as a result of the bill.\n\n\n  The New Hampshire Municipal Association states it is unable to determine the number of municipalities, if any, currently providing less paid sick leave than that contemplated by the bill.

The court shall order the appropriate agencies\nto suspend all licenses subject to this subdivision that are\nheld by the employer if the employer fails to file a signed\nsworn affidavit with the county attorney within three\nbusiness days after the order is issued. All licenses that are\nsuspended under this subdivision for failing to file a signed\nsworn affidavit shall remain suspended until the employer\nfiles a signed sworn affidavit with the county attorney. For\nthe purposes of this subdivision, the licenses that are\nsubject to suspension under this subdivision are all licenses\nthat are held by the employer specific to the business 504\nlocation where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the\nemployer does not hold a license specific to the business\nlocation where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a\nlicense is necessary to operate the employer's business in\ngeneral, the licenses that are subject to suspension under\nthis subdivision are all licenses that are held by the\nemployer at the employer's primary place of business. On\nreceipt of the court's order and notwithstanding any other\nlaw, the appropriate agencies shall suspend the licenses\naccording to the court's order. The court shall send a copy of\nthe court's order to the attorney general and the attorney\ngeneral shall maintain\nthe copy pursuant to subsection G of this section.\n\n \n(2) For a second violation, as described in paragraph 3 of this\nsubsection, the court shall order the appropriate agencies to\npermanently revoke all licenses that are held by the employer\nspecific to the business location where the unauthorized alien\nperformed work. If the employer does not hold a license specific to\nthe business location where the unauthorized alien performed work,\nbut a license is necessary to operate the employer's business in\ngeneral, the court shall order the appropriate agencies to\npermanently revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at\nthe employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order\nand notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate agencies shall\nimmediately revoke the licenses.\n \n(3) The violation shall be considered:\n \n\n(a) A first violation by an employer at a business location if\nthe violation did not occur during a probationary period\nordered by the court under this subsection or other state\nlaw, for that employer's business location.\n \n(b) A second violation by an employer at a business location\nif the violation occurred during a probationary period\nordered by the court under this subsection or other state\nlaw, for that employer's business location.\n\n \n(G) The attorney general shall maintain copies of court orders that are\nreceived pursuant to subsection F of this section and shall maintain a\ndatabase of the employers and business locations that have a first violation\nof subsection A of this section and make the court orders available on the\nattorney general's website.\n \n(H) On determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court\n\nSpare4\nMainTopStamp\n\n\n\n(H) On determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court\nshall consider only the federal government's determination pursuant to 8\nUnited States Code section 1373(c). The federal government's\ndetermination creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's lawful\nstatus. The court may take judicial notice of the federal government's\ndetermination and may request the federal government to provide\nautomated or testimonial verification pursuant to 8 United States Code\nsection 1373(c).\n \n(I) For the purposes of this section, proof of verifying the employment\nauthorization of an employee through the e-verify program creates a\nrebuttable presumption that an employer did not intentionally employ an\nunauthorized alien.\n \n(J) For the purposes of this section, an employer that establishes 549 that it\nhas complied in good faith with the requirements of 8 United States Code\nsection 1324a(b) establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did\nnot intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is considered\nto have complied with the requirements of 8 United States Code section\n1324a(b),  notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic or accidental technical or\nprocedural failure to meet the requirements, if there is a good faith attempt\nto comply with the requirements.\n \n(K) An employer is not entrapped under this section if the employer was\npredisposed to violate subsection A of this section and law enforcement\nofficers or their agents merely provided the employer with an opportunity\nto violate subsection A of this section. It is not entrapment for law\nenforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse or to conceal their\nidentity.\n\n \nSection 8. {Verification of employment eligibility; e-verify program;\neconomic development incentives; list of registered employers;\nviolation.}\n \n\n(A) After December 31, 2007, every employer, after hiring an employee,\nshall verify the employment eligibility of the employee through the e-verify\nprogram AND SHALL KEEP A RECORD OF THE VERIFICATION.\n \n(B) In addition to any other requirement for an employer to receive an\neconomic development incentive from a government entity, the employer\nshall register with and participate in the e-verify program. Before receiving\nthe economic development incentive, the employer shall provide proof to\nthe government entity that the employer is registered with and is\nparticipating in the e-verify program. If the government entity determines\nthat the employer is not complying with this subsection, the government\nentity shall notify the employer by certified mail of the government entity's\ndetermination of noncompliance and the employer's right to appeal the\ndetermination. On a final determination of noncompliance, the employer\nshall repay all monies received as an economic development incentive to\nthe government entity within thirty days of the final determination. For the\npurposes of this subsection:\n \n\n(1) \"Economic development incentive\" means any grant, loan or\nperformance based incentive from any government entity that is\nawarded after September 30, 2008.\n \n(2) \"Government entity\" means this state and any political\nsubdivision of this state that receives and uses tax revenues.\n\n \n(C) Every three months the attorney general shall request from the United\nStates Department of Homeland Security a list of employers from this state\nthat are registered with the e-verify program. On receipt of the list of\nemployers, the attorney general shall make the list available on the\nattorney general's website.\n\n \nSection 9. {Severability, implementation and construction.}\n \n\n(A) If a provision of this act or its application to any person or 594\ncircumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions\n\nSpare4\nMainTopStamp\n\n\n\ncircumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions\nor applications of the act that can be given effect without the invalid\nprovision or application, and to this end the provisions of this act are\nseverable.\n \n(B) The terms of this act regarding immigration shall be construed to have\nthe meanings given to them under federal immigration law.\n \n(C) This act shall be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws\nregulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all persons and\nrespecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens.\n\n \n\nAbout Members Login Logout Events & Meetings\nModel Legislation Task Forces ALEC Initiatives Publications Home\n\nJoin ALEC Contact News\n\nuser1\nFooter\n\nUser 3\nText Box\nCenter for Media and Democracy's quick summary:\n\nUser 3\nText Box\nThis Model Act closely resembles the infamous Arizona SB1070 law in its effort to mandate local enforcement of federal immigration law, allow private citizens to sue if they feel their town, city, county or state government is not \"fully\" enforcing immigration law (and requiring that taxpayer dollars be used to pay fines of up to $5000 + attorney's fees), making it a crime to have an illegal immigrant in one's vehicle, making presence on state soil without federal immigration status a criminal offense, and requiring that employers use the E-Verify system (and further criminalizing the employment of illegal immigrants). Among the Act's many problems, it prohibits local governments from deciding how best to allocate limited law enforcement resources to confront the most pressing public safety threats and interferes with the law enforcement-community relationship. The citizen lawsuit provision further interferes with that law enforcement prioritization by allowing private citizens to sue local government if they feel that not enough resources are allocated towards immigration enforcement. It is not difficult to imagine that a person might erroneously believe immigration laws are not being enforced because their neighbors are brown and speak Spanish with one another and bring a lawsuit, failing to recognize that their neighbors are also U.S. citizens. Section 3 creates a new category of crime by making presence on state land a \"trespass\" if the person does not have proper federal immigration papers, and bars any judicial discretion in sentencing; it also makes it a felony to be convicted under this new \"trespass\" law more than once.\n\n\n\n\n", "match": 3}, "24": {"url": "http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/documents/hb2578_00_0000.pdf", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession of 2012\n\nHOUSE BILL No. 2578\n\nBy Committee on Federal and State Affairs\n\n1-31\n\nAN ACT concerning immigration; relating to the enforcement of federal \nimmigration  laws;  concerning  the  determination  of  citizenship; \nnotification;  exchange  of  information;  indemnification; \nimplementation; cooperative agreements.\n\nBe it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:\nSection 1.\u2003(a) No official  or  agency of a  governmental  entity may \n\nadopt  a  policy  that  limits  or  restricts  the  enforcement  of  federal \nimmigration laws to less than the full extent permitted by federal law, or \nthat  in  any way limits  communication  between its  officers  and federal \nimmigration officials in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373.

Ott, Danou, \nTauchen, Krug, Strachota, Ripp, Honadel, Farrow and Thiesfeldt, \ncosponsored by Senators Wanggaard, Leibham, Holperin, Lazich, Cowles, \nOlsen, Vukmir, Grothman, Hansen, Galloway, Darling, Harsdorf, Hopper, \nTaylor and Moulton. Referred to Committee on Judiciary and Ethics.\n\n\n\nAB69,1,2\n1An Act to create 895.62 and 939.48 (1m) of the statutes; relating to: the \n2privilege of self-defense.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau\n\n\nIn general, a person who uses force in self-defense or in the defense of another \nperson may not be convicted of a crime stemming from that use of force.  This law \napplies only when:  1) the amount of force used is reasonable; and 2) the person uses \nthat force to prevent or stop what he or she reasonably believes is an unlawful \ninterference with himself or herself or another person, such as the crime of battery.  \nCurrent law specifies that a person may use force that is intended or likely to cause \nthe death of or great bodily harm to another individual only if the person reasonably \nbelieves that using such force is necessary to prevent the imminent death of or great \nbodily harm to himself or herself or another person.\n\n\nUnder this bill, if a person used defensive force that was intended or likely to \ncause death or great bodily harm, the court must presume that the person reasonably \nbelieved that the force was necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself \nor herself or to another person if:  1) the individual against whom the force was used \nwas in the process of unlawfully and forcibly entering, or had already unlawfully and \nforcefully entered, the residence of the person who used the force; 2) the person was \npresent in that residence; and 3) the person knew or reasonably believed that an \nunlawful and forcible entry was occurring or had occurred.  This presumption, \nhowever, does not apply if:  1) the person who used the force was engaged in a criminal \nactivity or was using his or her residence to further a criminal activity; or 2) the \nindividual against whom the force was used had identified himself or herself as a \n\npeace officer (or was or should have been known to be a peace officer) and was \nentering the residence in the performance of his or her official duties.\n\n\nUnder the bill, a person who uses force that is intended or likely to cause death \nor great bodily harm is immune from civil liability if the person reasonably believed \nthat the force was necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or \nherself or to another person and if:  1) the individual against whom the force was used \nwas in the process of unlawfully and forcibly entering, or had already forcibly \nentered, the residence of the person who used the force; 2) the person who used the \nforce was present in the residence; and 3) the person who used the force knew or had \nreason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry was occurring or had occurred.  \nUnder the bill for purposes of civil immunity, a person is not presumed to have \nreasonably believed that the force was necessary if:  1) the person who used the force \nwas engaged in a criminal activity or was using his or her residence to further a \ncriminal activity; or 2) the individual against whom the force was used had identified \nhimself or herself as a peace officer (or was or should have been known to be a peace \nofficer) and was entering the residence in the performance of his or her official duties.\n\n\nUnder the bill, if a court finds that person who is sued in civil court is immune \nfrom liability, the person is entitled to attorney fees, court costs, compensation for \nincome loss, and other expenses the person incurred to defend himself or herself \nagainst the civil action.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do \nenact as follows:\n\nAB69, s. 1\n\n\n1Section \n1.  895.62 of the statutes is created to read:\n\nAB69,2,5\n2895.62  Use of force in response to unlawful and forcible entry into a \n3residence; civil liability immunity.

This paragraph applies only if at least one of the following applies:\n\nAB69,3,2120\n1.  The officer identified himself or herself to the actor before the force described \n21in sub. (2) was used by the actor.\n\nAB69,3,2322\n2.  The actor knew or reasonably should have known that the person entering \n23or attempting to enter his or her residence was a peace officer.\n\nAB69,4,2\n24(5)  In any civil action, if a court finds that a person is immune from civil liability \n25under sub. (2), the court shall award the person reasonable attorney fees, costs, \n\n1compensation for loss of income, and other costs of the litigation reasonably incurred \n2by the person.\n\nAB69, s. 2\n\n\n3Section \n2.  939.48 (1m) of the statutes is created to read:\n\nAB69,4,84\n939.48 (1m) (a)  If an actor intentionally used force that was intended or likely \n5to cause death or great bodily harm, the court shall presume that the actor \n6reasonably believed that the force was necessary to prevent imminent death or great \n7bodily harm to himself or herself if the actor makes such a claim under sub. (1) and \n8any of the following applies:\n\nAB69,4,129\n1.  The person against whom the force was used was in the process of unlawfully \n10and forcibly entering the actor's residence, the actor was present in the residence, \n11and the actor knew or reasonably believed that an unlawful and forcible entry was \n12occurring.\n\nAB69,4,1613\n2.  The person against whom the force was used was in the actor's residence \n14after unlawfully and forcibly entering it, the actor was present in the residence, and \n15the actor knew or reasonably believed that the person had unlawfully and forcibly \n16entered the residence.\n\nAB69,4,1817\n(b)  The presumption described in par. (a) does not apply if any of the following \n18applies:\n\nAB69,4,2019\n1.  The actor was engaged in a criminal activity or was using his or her residence \n20to further a criminal activity at the time.\n\nAB69,4,2321\n2.  The person against whom the force was used was a peace officer who entered \n22or attempted to enter the actor's residence in the performance of his or her official \n23duties.  This subdivision applies only if at least one of the following applies:\n\nAB69,4,2524\na.  The officer identified himself or herself to the actor before the force described \n25in par. (a) was used by the actor.\n\nAB69,5,2\n\n1b.  The actor knew or reasonably should have known that the person entering \n2or attempting to enter his or her residence was a peace officer.\n\nAB69, s. 3\n\n\n3Section \n3.\nInitial applicability.\n\nAB69,5,5\n4(1)  This act first applies to a use of force that occurs on the effective date of this \n5subsection.\n\nAB69,5,66\n(End)\n\n            Down\n\n        Down\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    /2011/related/proposals/ab69\n    true\n    proposaltext\n    /2011/related/proposals/ab69\n    proposaltext/2011/REG/AB69\n    proposaltext/2011/REG/AB69\n    section\n    true\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\tMenu\n\t\u00bb2011\n\t\u00bbRelated Documents\n\t\u00bbProposal Text\n\t\u00bbAB69: Bill Text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n      \u00d7\n    \n    \n      Details for\n      \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n          PDF view\n        \n        \n\n    \n     Link (Permanent link)\n\n     Bookmark this location\n\n     View toggle\n\n     Go to top of document\n\n    \n\n     Cross references for section\n\n     Acts affecting this section\n\n     References to this\n\n     1970 Statutes Annotations\n\n     Appellate Court Citations\n\n    \n\n     Reference lines\n\n     Clear highlighting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "match": 5}, "37": {"url": "http://legisweb.state.wy.us/2008/Enroll/HB0137.pdf", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008 Budget Session - Enrolled Act HEA0059\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nORIGINAL HOUSE ENGROSSED \nBILL   NO.  0137 \n \n\nENROLLED ACT NO. 59,  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n \n\nFIFTY-NINTH LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WYOMING \n2008 BUDGET SESSION \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n 1 \n \n\n \n\nAN ACT relating to crimes and offenses; providing immunity \nfrom civil action for using deadly force as specified; \nallowing for the use of physical or deadly force under \nspecified circumstances in defending a person, premises, \nproperty or in response to the commission of a crime; \nproviding definitions; providing for conforming amendments; \nand providing for an effective date. \n \n\nBe It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Wyoming: \n \n\nSection 1.

like China, Russia, Mexico, and India emit an ever-increasing amount of carbon into the atmosphere;\n\nWHEREAS, a tremendous amount of economic growth would be sacrificed for a reduction in carbon emissions that would have no appreciable impact on global concentrations of CO2;\n\nWHEREAS, no state or nation has enhanced economic opportunities for its citizens or increased Gross Domestic Product

The amendment shall be known as and may be cited as the Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment.\n\n\nSECTION II. The Legislature makes the following findings concerning religious freedom: \n\n\n(1) The framers of the United States Constitution, recognizing free exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured its protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution, and the framers of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, also recognizing this right, secured the protection of religious freedom in Article I, Section 3.\n\n\n(2) Federal and state laws \"neutral\" toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise.\n\n\n(3) Governments should not burden religious exercise without compelling justification.\n\n\n(4) In Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), the United States Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement that the government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by laws neutral toward religion.\n\n\n(5) The compelling interest test as set forth in prior court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing governmental interests in areas ranging from public education (pedagogical interests and religious rights, including recognizing regulations necessary to alleviate interference with the educational process versus rights of religious freedom) to national defense (conscription and conscientious objection, including the need to raise an army versus rights to object to individual participation), and other areas of important mutual concern.\n\n\n(6) Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C., \u00a7 2000bb, to establish the compelling interest test set forth in prior federal court rulings, but in City of Boerne v. Flores, 117 S.Ct. 2157 (1997), the United States Supreme Court held the act unconstitutional stating that the right to regulate was retained by the states.\n\n\nSECTION III. The purpose of the Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment is to guarantee that the freedom of religion is not burdened by state and local law; and to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious freedom is burdened by government.\n\n\nSECTION IV. As used in this amendment, the following words shall have the following meanings:\n\n\n(1) DEMONSTRATES. Meets the burdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion.\n\n\n(2) FREEDOM OF RELIGION. The free exercise of religion under Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.\n\n\n(3) GOVERNMENT. Any branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under the color of law) of the State of Alabama, any political subdivision of a state, municipality, or other local government.\n\n\n(4) RULE. Any government statute, regulation, ordinance, administrative provision, ruling guideline, requirement, or any statement of law whatever.\n\n\nSECTION V. (a) Government shall not burden a person's freedom of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b).\n\n\n(b) Government may burden a person's freedom of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person:\n\n\n(1) Is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and\n\n\n(2) Is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\n\n\n(c) A person whose religious freedom has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.\n\n\nSECTION VI. (a) This amendment applies to all government rules and implementations thereof, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after the effective date of this amendment.\n\n\n(b) Nothing in this amendment shall be construed to authorize any government to burden any religious belief.\n\n\n(c) Nothing in this amendment shall be construed to affect, interpret, or in any way address those portions of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution permitting the free exercise of religion or prohibiting laws respecting the establishment of religion, or those provisions of Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, regarding the establishment of religion.\n\n\nSECTION VII. (a) This amendment shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial and deterrent purposes.\n\n\n(b) If any provision of this amendment or its application to any particular person or circumstance is held invalid, that provision or its application is severable and does not affect the validity of other provisions or applications of this amendment.\n\n\n\n", "match": 8}, "47": {"url": "http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill_text.asp?hsid=HB0162A&session=27https://legiscan.com/AL/text/HB19/id/327641/Alabama-2011-HB19-Enrolled.pdf", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHack attempt has been recorded\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\thome\n\tsenate\n\thouse\n\tbills &\tlaws\n\tsearches\n\tmedia center\n\tpublications\n\tget started\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\t \n\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\t Legislature(1957-1958) \n\n\tHack attempt has been recorded\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\nBasis\n Navigation\n\n\n\tBills\n\t\t\n\t\tStatistics\n\t\n\t\tActions by Date\n\t\n\t\tAwaiting Action\n\t\n\t\tGovernor's Vetoes\n\t\n\t\tPassed Legislation\n\t\n\t\tBills in Committee\n\t\n\t\tSponsor Summary\n\t\n\t\tRequestor Summary\n\t\n\t\tSubject Summary\n\n\n\n\tLegislators\n\t\tMember Information\n\n\n\n\tCommittees\n\t\t\n\t\tCommittee Membership\n\t\n\t\tMinutes and Audio\n\t\n\t\tHearing Schedules\n\t\n\t\tConference Committees\n\n\n\n\tSession\n\t\t\n\t\tHouse and Senate Calendars\n\t\n\t\tJournal Text Display\n\n\n\n\tSession Laws\n\t\t1957\n\t1958\n\t1957-1958\n\n\n\n\tTools\n\t\t\n\t\tStatute Information Retrieval System (SIRS)\n\t\n\t\tBill Tracking Management Facility (BTMF)\n\t\n\t\tExecutive Orders Current\n\t\n\t\tExecutive Orders Archive\n\t\n\t\tGavel to Gavel\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\tArchive\n\t\tThe 29th Legislature (2015-2016)\n\tThe 28th Legislature (2013-2014)\n\tThe 27th Legislature (2011-2012)\n\tThe 26th Legislature (2009-2010)\n\tThe 25th Legislature (2007-2008)\n\tThe 24th Legislature (2005-2006)\n\tThe 23rd Legislature (2003-2004)\n\tThe 22nd Legislature (2001-2002)\n\tThe 21st Legislature (1999-2000)\n\tThe 20th Legislature (1997-1998)\n\tThe 19th Legislature (1995-1996)\n\tThe 18th Legislature (1993-1994)\n\tInfobases (1982-1992) \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have triggered an error, maybe try to use the website correctly", "match": 9}, "48": {"url": "http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2012a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont3/0039C9417C9D9D5D87257981007F3CC9?open&file=1111_01.pdf", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site only supports frames compatible browsers!\n\n\t\n\n1111_01.pdf\t\n\n1111.01\t\n\nHB1111_00.pdf\t\n\nHB1111.00\t\n\nHB1111_C_001.pdf\t\n\nHB1111_C.001\n\n\n\n\t\n\nHB1111_J_001.pdf\t\n\nHB1111_J.001\t\n\nHB1111_hse.pdf\t\n\nHB1111.hse\t\n\n1111_eng.pdf\t\n\n1111.eng\n\n\n\n\t\n\n1111_ren.pdf\t\n\n1111.ren\t\n\nwptemp.txt\t\n\nHB1111_r1.pdf\t\n\nHB1111.r1\t\n\nHB1111_C_002.pdf\n\n\n\n\t\n\nHB1111_C.002\t\n\nHB1111_f1.pdf\t\n\nHB1111.f1\n\n\n\n\n", "match": 9}, "49": {"url": "http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2012/Bills/HB2221_.PDF", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES k I\nTWENTY-SIXTH LEGISLATURE, 2012 .

The\n\n10 lack of any requirement that a voter confirm his or her identity\n\n11 to a precinct official is a serious defect in our voting\n\n12 process.

bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted. \n \n\n \n\nAN ACT relating to elections; requiring photographic identification \nfor voting; requiring county clerks to issue voter \nidentification cards under certain circumstances; requiring \npersons who apply for absent ballots to provide certain \ninformation to county and city clerks; and providing other \nmatters properly relating thereto. \n\n \n\nLegislative Counsel\u2019s Digest: \n Existing law requires that a person provide satisfactory identification to vote in 1 \nperson or cast an absent ballot. (NRS 293.2725, 293.277, 293.303, 293.3081, 2 \n293.3082, 293.3083, 293.3085, 293.313, 293.3157, 293.316, 293.330, 293.353, 3 \n293.3585, 293.5235, 293.541, 293C.270, 293C.292, 293C.310, 293C.330, 4 \n293C.332, 293C.3585) This bill requires that a person provide one of the forms of 5 \nphotographic identification specified in section 2 of this bill to vote in person or 6 \ncast an absent ballot. Section 2 provides a definition of \u201cphotographic 7 \nidentification\u201d that is limited to a driver\u2019s license or identification card issued by 8 \nthe Department of Motor Vehicles, an identification card issued by a branch of the 9 \nArmed Forces of the United States, a United States passport, an identification card 10 \nissued by an Indian tribe or a voter identification card issued by a county clerk. 11 \nSections 3-6 of this bill: (1) require a county clerk to issue a voter identification 12 \ncard, free of charge, to a person who does not possess one of the forms of required 13 \nphotographic identification; (2) set forth requirements for the issuance of voter 14 \nidentification cards; and (3) require that the Secretary of State adopt regulations to 15 \ncarry out the provisions of those sections. 16 \n Under existing law, a registered voter who wishes to vote an absent ballot in an 17 \nelection must provide sufficient written notice to a city or county clerk in advance 18 \nof the election. (NRS 293.313, 293C.310) Sections 16 and 25 of this bill provide 19 \nthat the written notice must include the name, address and date of birth of the 20 \n\n\n\n \n \u2013 2 \u2013 \n \n\n - *SB373* \n\nregistered voter, a statement that the requester is a registered voter, a statement 21 \nidentifying the election for which the absent ballot is requested, the political 22 \naffiliation of the registered voter if the election is a primary election, the address to 23 \nwhich the absent ballot should be mailed and one other form of identifying 24 \ninformation or document of the registered voter.  25 \n The provisions of this bill which require that a person present one of the forms 26 \nof photographic identification specified in section 2 to vote in person or cast an 27 \nabsent ballot are similar to the provisions of an Indiana law which the United States 28 \nSupreme Court determined does not unconstitutionally burden a person\u2019s right to 29 \nvote, in part because the person can obtain one of the forms of required 30 \nphotographic identification free of charge. (Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 31 \n128 S. Ct. 1610 (2008)) 32 \n \n\n \n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN \nSENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: \n\n \n\n Section 1.
